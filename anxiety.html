          <h4 id="list-item-1">Anxiety Disorders</h4>
          <p>
            A common group of mental illnesses (panic disorder, OCD, PTSD,
            phobias) that can often cause people to feel frightened, distressed,
            or uneasy.
            <br />
            <br />
            Occasional anxiety is an expected part of life. You might feel
            anxious when faced with a problem at work, before taking a test, or
            before making an important decision. But anxiety disorders involve
            more than temporary worry or fear. For a person with an anxiety
            disorder, the anxiety does not go away and can get worse over time.
            The symptoms can interfere with daily activities such as job
            performance, school work, and relationships.
            <br />
            <br />
            There are several types of anxiety disorders, including generalized
            anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and various phobia-related
            disorders. Among the different anxiety disorders are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Generalized Anxiety Disorder:</b> People with generalized
              anxiety disorder (GAD) display excessive anxiety or worry, most
              days for at least 6 months, about a number of things such as
              personal health, work, social interactions, and everyday routine
              life circumstances.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Panic Disorder:</b> People with panic disorder have recurrent
              unexpected panic attacks. Panic attacks are sudden periods of
              intense fear that come on quickly and reach their peak within
              minutes. Attacks can occur unexpectedly or can be brought on by a
              trigger, such as a feared object or situation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Phobia-related disorders:</b> A phobia is an intense fear of—or
              aversion to—specific objects or situations. Although it can be
              realistic to be anxious in some circumstances, the fear people
              with phobias feel is out of proportion to the actual danger caused
              by the situation or object.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Social anxiety disorder (previously called social phobia):</b>
              People with social anxiety disorder have a general intense fear
              of, or anxiety toward, social or performance situations. They
              worry that actions or behaviors associated with their anxiety will
              be negatively evaluated by others, leading them to feel
              embarrassed.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4 id="list-item-2">Bipolar Disorder</h4>
          <p>
            An illness that typically includes extreme shifts in mood, energy,
            and functioning that include mania and depression.
            <br />
            <br />
            There are three types of bipolar disorder. All three types involve
            clear changes in mood, energy, and activity levels. These moods
            range from periods of extremely “up,” elated, irritable, or
            energized behavior (known as manic episodes) to very “down,” sad,
            indifferent, or hopeless periods (known as depressive episodes).
            Less severe manic periods are known as hypomanic episodes.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Bipolar I Disorder:</b> Defined by manic episodes that last at
              least 7 days, or by manic symptoms that are so severe that the
              person needs immediate hospital care. Usually, depressive episodes
              occur as well, typically lasting at least 2 weeks. Episodes of
              depression with mixed features (having depressive symptoms and
              manic symptoms at the same time) are also possible.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Bipolar II Disorder:</b> Defined by a pattern of depressive
              episodes and hypomanic episodes, but not the full-blown manic
              episodes that are typical of Bipolar I Disorder.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Cyclothymic Disorder (also called Cyclothymia):</b> Defined by
              periods of hypomanic symptoms as well as periods of depressive
              symptoms lasting for at least 2 years (1 year in children and
              adolescents). However, the symptoms do not meet the diagnostic
              requirements for a hypomanic episode and a depressive episode.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4 id="list-item-3">Depression</h4>
          <p>
            An illness that affects one’s thoughts, feelings, behavior, physical
            health, activity, and sleep patterns. Left untreated, it can lead to
            suicide.
            <br />
            <br />
            Depression is one of the most common mental disorders in the U.S..
            Current research suggests that depression is caused by a combination
            of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors. It
            can happen at any age, but often begins in adulthood. Depression is
            now recognized as occurring in children and adolescents, although it
            sometimes presents with more prominent irritability than low mood.
            Many chronic mood and anxiety disorders in adults begin as high
            levels of anxiety in children.
          </p>
          <h4 id="list-item-4">Eating Disorders</h4>
          <p>
            Eating disorders are serious and often fatal illnesses that are
            associated with severe disturbances in people’s eating behaviors and
            related thoughts and emotions. There are three main types:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Anorexia nervosa:</b> People with anorexia nervosa may see
              themselves as overweight, even when they are dangerously
              underweight. People with anorexia nervosa typically weigh
              themselves repeatedly, severely restrict the amount of food they
              eat, often exercise excessively, and/or may force themselves to
              vomit or use laxatives to lose weight.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Bulimia nervosa:</b> People with bulimia nervosa have recurrent
              and frequent episodes of eating unusually large amounts of food
              and feeling a lack of control over these episodes. This
              binge-eating is followed by behavior that compensates for the
              overeating such as forced vomiting, excessive use of laxatives or
              diuretics, fasting, excessive exercise, or a combination of these
              behaviors.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Binge-eating disorder:</b> People with binge-eating disorder
              lose control over his or her eating. Unlike bulimia nervosa,
              periods of binge-eating are not followed by purging, excessive
              exercise, or fasting. As a result, people with binge-eating
              disorder often are overweight or obese. Binge-eating disorder is
              the most common eating disorder in the U.S.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4 id="list-item-5">Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</h4>
          <p>
            Brought on by traumatic events, this disorder can be long-lasting
            and may include re-experiencing, avoidance, arousal, and numbing.
            Anyone can develop PTSD at any age. This includes war veterans,
            children, and people who have been through a physical or sexual
            assault, abuse, accident, disaster, or other serious events.
            <br />
            <br />
            It is natural to feel afraid during and after a traumatic situation.
            Fear triggers many split-second changes in the body to help defend
            against danger or to avoid it. This “fight-or-flight” response is a
            typical reaction meant to protect a person from harm. Nearly
            everyone will experience a range of reactions after trauma, yet most
            people recover from initial symptoms naturally. Those who continue
            to experience problems may be diagnosed with PTSD.
